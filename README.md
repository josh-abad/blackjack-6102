## Note
Back when I was still working on this, I made another branch for rewriting the game in JavaFX. I was still new to FX at the time, thus that branch went nowhere. Now, I've mostly abandoned the development as this was just for a school project, which is now over. However, I wanted to finish the new, sleeker version I wanted to do back when I was first messing around in JavaFX. So this, essentially, has totally rewritten GUI code, using FXML and CSS for layout and styling, respectively. The model, or logic of the game, remains more or less the same.

In terms of appearance, the game now (kind of) follows Google's Material Design guidelines. This is to give the game a more modern look as well as fuelling my fascination with that design language.

## Libraries used
* **JFoenix** - for the Material components
* **FontAwesomeFX** - for Material Design icons
* **JavaFX** - because VSCode complains about the version of JavaFX in JDK8

## Acknowledgements
The card icons are made by Kenney.
